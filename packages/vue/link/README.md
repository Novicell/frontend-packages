# Novicell Breadcrumb Vue Component
A Vue link component, that automatically switches between and anchor-tag and NuxtLink, depending on whether the provided link is internal or external.

## Installation
To install this component, simply run `npm i @novicell/link`, ~~or reference it in a script tag: `<script src="example"></script>`~~.

## Usage
This component can be used in a SFC, if you are compiling your own Vue components by simply including: `import NcLink from '@novicell/link` in your Vue component script.

Alternatively a precompiled component will be automatically registered on your Vue instance when including it with a script tag as specified under [Installation](#installation).

## Commands
npm run dev // try out the component in the browser
npm run build // builds the component for both SFC usage and through a script tag
